# Fast-MultiThreaded-ProxyChecker

MacOSx/Linux/Windows Multi-threaded Proxy Checker, User Friendly
=============

I wanted to make a portable, simple, fast, and easy-to-use Python Proxy Checker for web scraping.

# Installation
```bash
git clone URL
cd REPO_DIRECTORY
```

Installing the third-party modules:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
OR

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Proxy Checker
```

python3 ./main.py

```

TODOs:
1) Add socket as a checker type (currently only supports web)
2) More testing on Linux & Windows (Developed on Mac OS X)
3) Proxy Sorter for unknown proxies
